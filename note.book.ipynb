      "\n",
      "#### Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prepare the Chickpeas**: If using dried chickpeas, soak them overnight in water. Drain and rinse, then cook in boiling water until tender (about 1-1.5 hours). If using canned chickpeas, simply drain and rinse them.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Heat Oil**: In a large pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.\n",
